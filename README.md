# CosmicCritic

CosmicCritic is a React Flask web application utilizing Material UI for rating and reviewing science fiction books. Users can browse through the list of books, view details on the books, and see other user's ratings and reviews. Upon signing up for an account, the user can leave their own ratings and reviews on the books. The user has the ability to edit or delete these reviews, as well as view statistics, like the average of their ratings and the number of reviews they have left.
